# SyriaTel-Customer-Churn-Prediction
## Overview
Customer churn is a huge challenge in the telecommunication industry today. This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts which customers are likely to churn. By identifying them early, SyriaTel can take proactive measures that can improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.

## 1. Business Understanding
SyriaTel is a telecommunication company that is highly affected by customer churn and this is leading to revenue loss. The company needs an early warning system to identify which customers might be leaving soon so they can take necessary actions to retain them.

*Objectives*
- Predict churn.
- Analyze key factors leading to churn.
- Recommendations on how they can reduce customer churn leading to increase in revenue.

## 2. Data Understanding
This dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset?resource=download). This dataset is going to help us build the model. The key features include:

*Customer information* - State, Acc. length, Area code and Phone number

*Service plan* - International plan and voice mail plan.

*Usage data* - Total minutes, calls and charge (day, evening, night)

*Customer support interaction* - Customer service calls
